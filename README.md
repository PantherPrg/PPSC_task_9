# PPSC_task_9: Water Bottle Refiller
**| difficulty: 2/10 |**

For a new middle school in your town, you are tasked to program the water bottle refillers to be placed in the halls. When a bottle is detected, it will only be refilled if it is less than half full. Then, you have to calculate how much water must be dispensed. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
Float size (The size of the entire bottle in ounces)
Float filled (The amount of water inside the bottle in ounces)
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
Float waterNeeded (Rounded to the hundredth, return 0 if the bottle does not need refilling, 2 decimal points need to be shown, whether it is an integer or not.)

Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.

**optional challenge: write your code in under 6 lines**

This problem covers if statements, float types, percentages, and decimal formatting. Do your research if you need it. **Google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
